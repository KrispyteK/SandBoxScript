# Skrypt-Language
Skrypt is a general purpose scripting language. It's an interpreted language thats compiled at runtime, is weakly typed supports object-oriented, functional and imperative programming styles. The goal of Skrypt is to create an easy to use scripting language that combines familiar ideas and syntax from other languages.

Skrypt includes a fully working executable REPL, an extensive standard library and interoperability with .NET.

While Skrypt has an extensive list of features, it's still in a prototypal stage. Syntax, semantics and the inner workings of the language are subject to change. Feature or change requests, bug reports in the form of GitHub Issues or Pull Requests are welcome and encouraged.
